This is a static website making use of HTML and CSS.

The site is for a chef-author who writes short horror stories about restaurant workers and sells them on Amazon. The site's purpose is to create a theme-space for potential buyers to get a glimpse of the author's background and writing style to help produce more sales.

The original site was made in squarespace, but was buggy, and full of continuity errors. I took the original wireframe and re-wrote the site to be more unified and streamlined in order to present a better product to the end user.
